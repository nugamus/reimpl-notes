# Evidence (<Engine> engine)

Append-only proof for every claim in this engine's specs (rule 1). Never edit an entry;
supersede it with a new one that names the old id.

Entry format:

```
### E-0001 — <one-line claim> (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Source:** Ghidra `<program>!0x<address>` (`<name>`), an assert path, a trace line
  (`traces/INDEX.md` entry), or a corpus statistic (the script and its output).
- **Shows:** what that source says, in words (never pasted decompiler output, rule 3).
- **Used by:** the spec or format sections that rely on it.
```

Numbering: E-0001.. survey and binaries, E-0100.. the first format area, and so on in blocks
of 100 per area, so related entries stay together.
