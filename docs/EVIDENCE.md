# Evidence log

Every factual claim made anywhere in `docs/` must have an entry here that names the thing
that proved it. Claims without evidence are bugs, not shortcuts.

Append only. Do not rewrite history; if a claim turns out to be wrong, add a new entry
that supersedes it and mark the old one `SUPERSEDED by E-nnnn`.

## Entry format

```
### E-0001 — <one-line claim>
- **Binary/file:** MissionMonet.exe | x3d.dll | Data/U01.X3D | traces/2026-08-30-intro.log
- **Evidence:** Ghidra address (`0x004ab120`), assert source path + line
  (`D:\MissionD\Source\XScene.cpp:412`), trace line number, or corpus statistic
  ("all 214 .O3D files have `4X3D` at offset 0").
- **Method:** how it was obtained (decompiled `FUN_004ab120`; ran
  `tools/parsers/o3d.py` over the corpus; proxy trace of the intro sequence).
- **Confidence:** proven | strong | tentative
```

An entry at `tentative` confidence must also have a matching line in
`docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`.

## Entries

### E-0001 — Game binaries and engine DLLs ship in the installer payload, not preinstalled
- **Binary/file:** `Original Game Files/INSTALL/02_PR/`
- **Evidence:** directory listing contains `MissionMonet.exe`, `MissionD.exe`, `x3d.dll`,
  `h3d.dll`, `4xvideo.dll`, `AviPlay.dll`, `MSVCRTD.DLL`, plus previously unlisted
  `x3dmp5.dll`, `x3dmp6.dll`, `x3dmp6k.dll`, `x3dsdk.dll`, `xd3d.dll`, `xs3d.dll`,
  `flc.dll`, `SMACKW32.DLL`.
- **Method:** `find` over the extracted CD image at bootstrap.
- **Confidence:** proven

### E-0002 — `MSVCRTD.DLL` is redistributed alongside the game binaries
- **Binary/file:** `Original Game Files/INSTALL/02_PR/MSVCRTD.DLL`
- **Evidence:** file present in the shipping payload. Consistent with the CLAUDE.md ground
  truth that both EXEs are MSVC 6 debug builds — a release build would link `MSVCRT.DLL`.
- **Method:** directory listing.
- **Confidence:** strong

### E-0003 — "87 x3d.dll exports" is an import count; the DLL exports 278
- **Binary/file:** `INSTALL/02_PR/x3d.dll`, `h3d.dll`, and the other engine DLLs
- **Evidence:** PE export directories, read with `pefile`:
  `x3d.dll` 278 symbols, all prefixed `X3d_`; `h3d.dll` 52, all `H3d_`;
  `x3dsdk.dll` 63 `X3dsdk_`; `xd3d.dll` 29 and `xs3d.dll` 28, both exporting the same
  `X3d_*_Dll` names (`X3d_Add_Camera_Dll`, `X3d_Add_Face_Dll`, ...);
  `x3dmp5.dll` / `x3dmp6.dll` / `x3dmp6k.dll` 31 each, same names, all matrix and polar
  helpers (`X3d_Matrice_Inverse`, `X3d_Convert_To_Polar`);
  `4xvideo.dll` 1 (`Video4x_Init`); `AviPlay.dll` 5 named (`AviOpenFile`, `AviPlayMovie`,
  `AviSetWindow`, `AviGetStatus`, `AviClose`); `flc.dll` 1 (`Flc_Unpack`).
  `x3d-api-surface.md` says so in its own header — "x3d.dll (87 imported symbols)" — the
  87 is what the two EXEs import, not what the DLL exports.
- **Method:** `pefile.PE(...).DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT.symbols` over every DLL in
  `INSTALL/02_PR/`.
- **Confidence:** proven
- **Consequence:** the Phase 1 proxy `.def` needs all 278 `x3d.dll` names, not 87. A
  proxy that exports only what the EXEs import will fail to satisfy any other DLL that
  links against `x3d.dll`.

### E-0004 — `AviPlay.dll` exports by name, not by ordinal
- **Binary/file:** `INSTALL/02_PR/AviPlay.dll`
- **Evidence:** export table contains the five names listed in E-0003. CLAUDE.md
  previously described it as "ordinal-only".
- **Method:** same `pefile` sweep.
- **Confidence:** proven

### E-0005 — Both EXE build timestamps match the stated ground truth
- **Binary/file:** `MissionMonet.exe`, `MissionD.exe`
- **Evidence:** PE `FILE_HEADER.TimeDateStamp` = 2000-10-02 and 2000-10-09; sizes
  339,968 and 618,543 bytes; both `Machine = 0x14c` (x86-32).
- **Method:** `pefile` header read.
- **Confidence:** proven

### E-0006 — All 13 engine binaries import and auto-analyse cleanly in Ghidra 12.1.3
- **Binary/file:** `ghidra_projects/Monet.gpr`
- **Evidence:** headless run logged 13 × `REPORT: Analysis succeeded`, 0 errors, exit 0.
  Log at `logs/ghidra-import.log` (gitignored).
- **Method:** `analyzeHeadless ghidra_projects Monet -import <13 binaries>
  -analysisTimeoutPerFile 2400`, via the `C:\ghidra` junction (the stock `.bat` fails on
  the space in the repo path).
- **Confidence:** proven
